| 2007&nbsp;to&nbsp;2012 | [TomTom]({{< relref "../projects/tomtom/index.md" >}} "TomTom") | My first corporate experience in Software Development. I have the fondest memories of it. A fun product in a fun, young environment. Lots of C++ and Java. ðŸŒŽ [(details)]({{< relref "../projects/tomtom/index.md" >}} "TomTom") | [![Academic Research](go1000-400.jpg)]({{< relref "../projects/tomtom/index.md" >}} "TomTom") |
| 2003&nbsp;to&nbsp;2006 | [Academic&nbsp;Research]({{< relref "../projects/academic-research/index.md" >}} "Academic Research") | My academic research and Master's Thesis on Scale-Free Networks and the Internet topology. This worked allowed me to publish five articles and win a grant at the University of Amsterdam under the HPC Europa program. ðŸŽ“ [(details)]({{< relref "../projects/academic-research/index.md" >}} "Academic Research") | [![Academic Research](scale-free-network-example-400.png)]({{< relref "../projects/academic-research/index.md" >}} "Academic Research") |

| 1998&nbsp;to&nbsp;2001 | [Litfinternet]({{< relref "../projects/litfinternet/index.md" >}} "Litfinternet") | My first website, pure HTML written entirely by hand with Notepad on an old Amstrad 286.
