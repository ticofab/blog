Like many others, I find myself out of work during the Covid19 crisis of Spring 2020.

I imagine that finding work in the coming months would be challenging but probably feasible. After a little thinking, I decided to take a little time for myself. A carefree month or two, then figure out what comes next. I am privileged enough to be able to afford a couple of months without income, and in fact every time I've done it before it has always had a positive impact on my life.

April is my last month of work, so I started collecting ideas on what to do/learn after. At the moment of writing, it is very unclear to which extent we will be able to resume 'normal' life. My home country Italy announced that confinement measures will be in place well into May and the Netherlands (where I live) could follow on the same path.

This post is meant to be a living "To-Learn" list. I will add/or modify items from now to the end of my off-work period. Careful planning is one of the most effective strategies in the incredible book [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) by Cal Newport, and this coarse level of planning is the first step. Edits will be documented -- the goal is a sort of 'event-sourced' list.
