Why this domain name?

My name is Fabio Tiriticco, and some of my friends call me Tico. That is where my internet handle **ticofab** comes from. My personal domain is **ticofab.io**. I'm sure you have noticed the 'fabio' in the domain :-)

*Voil√†*, domain name explained. Find more about myself in the about section of this blog, plus the Linkedin / Twitter links in the left bar.
