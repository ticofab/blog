This picture was taken as I entered Las Vegas on a Greyhound bus on an August night. It was 5pm, I was coming from Flagstaff, Arizona. The bus had briefly stopped in a squallid McDonald around 2am. I had slept very little during the journey, nonetheless I was awake in excitement as we entereed into town. I was going to spend 19 more sleepless hours in Sin City and I knew it. Despite the early hour, the city wasn't sleeping either.
