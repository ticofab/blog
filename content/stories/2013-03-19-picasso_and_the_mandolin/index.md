Picasso painted _Girl With a Mandolin_ in 1910. I just think it's a really, really cool painting.

PS: I could have used an "official" picture of this painting. It would have probably been of a better quality. I just like to use these pics that I took myself. I don't know, it feels like more authentic and less of a schoolbook.
