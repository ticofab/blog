About 15 years ago, like all teenagers of those times (?), I was in love with the keyboard player of the American band [The Dandy Warhols](http://www.dandywarhols.com/). As time went by, I found that she could range from hot to ugly, according to the photographer. Anyways, last year I dragged my friend Albert to see a concert of them, a last-minute thing arranged in Amsterdam as one of their German dates had been canceled.

The concert was more pleasant than I expected, but unfortunately I had grown up in the meantime. This video below is one of their coolest songs to date. The girl is quite hot here too. Thanks to the photographer.
