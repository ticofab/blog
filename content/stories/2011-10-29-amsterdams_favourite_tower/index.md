I was just back from my six-month world wandering. I had some of my best friends around again, living with them even. One afternoon we were sitting on the couch, chatting side by side. Just out of the window, my favourite tower of Amsterdam. It must be beautiful out there. Yet I didn't want to go anywhere else than where I already was.
