_I decided to start publishing short stories, accompanied by a nice picture. This isn't a journal - just random little episodes from anywhere in time. Enjoy!_

Renting a bike in San Francisco sounds like a short-sighted idea. I mean, it's the hilliest US city by definition. Yet it will enable you to an epic ride to and across the iconic Golden Gate bridge. The trail will even let you see its metallic legs under the skirt.
