Horsha was a startup in stealth-mode which never came out of the stealth-mode. The idea was a social network specialized
for horse owners to help them share the care (and the costs) of a horse. Over time, it evolved in a full-blown clone of
Facebook, with pictures, events, likes, friends and so forth. 

I worked there for about a year and was in charge of the Android app, which was coming together quite nicely.

The project ran for a few years in total, always in stealth-mode, before being finally killed without ever seen the light.
I can't help thinking that by avoiding feature creep and following the most basic startup advice (release fast, iterate
fast, fail fast) history could have been different.
