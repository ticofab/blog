Horsha (from 'Horse' + 'Share') was a startup in stealth-mode which never came out of the stealth-mode. The idea was a social network specialized
for horse owners to help them share the care (and the costs) of a horse. Over time, it evolved in a full-blown clone of
Facebook, with pictures, events, likes, friends and so forth. 

I worked there for about a year and was in charge of the Android app, which was coming together quite nicely.

During that time, I also started working on one of my most successful open-source projects, [Android GPX Parser](https://github.com/ticofab/android-gpx-parser),
a library built specifically for Android to parse the GPX files produced by GPS tracking devices. We needed it for the
"share ride" functionality.

The project ran for a few years in total, always in stealth-mode, before being finally abandoned without ever seeing the light.
I can't help thinking that by avoiding feature creep and following the most basic startup advice (release fast, iterate
fast, fail fast) history could have been different.
